# The Nathaniel Clinic Homepage
The Nathaniel Clinic is CASESâ€™ State-licensed behavioral health clinic located in Central Harlem. Although it offers many services designed to meet the unique needs of people with justice involvement, the Nathaniel Clinic is open to the larger community and serves both youth and adults.

To emphasize the clinic's open door policy (and to help clear up the misconception that justice involvement was a requirement for admission), we decided to differentiate the Nathaniel Clinic with unique branding distinct from that of its parent organization. This repository houses the source files for the companion landing page for the rebrand.

From design to development to deployment, the site was completed in approximately 48 hours.

## Installation?
Techwise, the page is really pretty vanilla. Outside of a bit jQuery for the scrollspy (thanks [Bootstrap] (https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Popper](https://popper.js.org/)), the site uses just plain old HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's nice to get away from the command line every now and then.
